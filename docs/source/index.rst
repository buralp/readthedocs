Before using MPManager
----------------------

The key component(s) of the system is a mixture of meter/customer. That
means both melts into each other a bit. The only way to register a
customer or a meter is to register them both at the same time. For that
reason from now on, every registered person will be mentioned as a
**customer**.

Register a customer & meter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an additional `Android
Application <https://github.com/inensus/Customer-Meter-Registration>`__
that should be used to register a customer with a meter together. The
application allows you to select the village where the customer lives,
the meter manufacturer, and the energy tariff that should be assigned to
the meter.

Tariffs
~~~~~~~

Its basically the energy price per kWh with an optional access
rate/subscription fee. The operator is free to define the period of that
fee. Ex: Every 7 days.

Payment Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

or now, the system supports only incoming payments from Airtel Tanzania
and Vodacom Tanzania. Both providers are accepting Mobile Money and
notify the MPManager over a secure tunnel.

Payments
~~~~~~~~

Each incoming payment has to contain the meter number. That is the
unique number that is used to identify the other channels where the
money could spend. After payment is been received the system
automatically checks these further points; 1. Missing Asset Type Rates
2. Not paid Access Rates 3. Convert the money to energy and generate an
STS-Token for the calculated energy amount. At the end of the payment
process, the customer will be notified about each step.

At the end of the payment process the customer will be notified about
each step.

If the entered meter number is not valid the system refuses the payment
automatically.

Selling an Asset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system supports to sell assets to customers on a rate basis plan. A
water pump or a milling machine will be a good example of that.

Targets
-------

A target can be assigned to a whole cluster or for a single Mini-Grid.
The important thing by assigning a target is;

If the target is assigned to a cluster, the manager will see only that
target on the cluster dashboard. However, if a single Mini-Grid or all
Mini-Grids in a cluster has a defined target. The manager will see the
calculated sum of these targets.

Example: Cluster 1 has following Mini-Grids; MG-1 MG-2 and MG-3

+-------------------+--------+--------+--------+
| #                 | MG-1   | MG-2   | MG-3   |
+===================+========+========+========+
| New Connections   | Â 100   | 200    | 500    |
+-------------------+--------+--------+--------+

The result of the cluster overview page would be 800 for expected new
connections.

MPManager
---------

**Note: The pages that contain only a ``List of X`` and a ``Add new X``
button without any other key feature are not explained below.**

Clusters Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is basically the whole overview of the business. It shows some quick
information like total revenue, registered meters and the number of
registered clusters.

There are also more sections; 1. **Financial overview:** That breaks the
total revenue to Mini-Grid level. The manager can see/analyse each
Mini-Grid with that. 2. **Cluster Map:** The maps shows graphically
where the clusters are located. The clusters on the map are clickable
and forwards the manager to the next level dashboard **Cluster
Dashboard**

To register a new cluster find the red plus button on the right bottom
corner of the screen.

Cluster Dashboard
-----------------

The cluster dashboard is built similar to the clusters dashboard. There
are small informative boxes at the top of the screen. The financial
overview and the map are based on Mini-Grids instead of clusters.

There are two new sections available; 1. Revenue Analysis: That is the
place where all targets of MiniGrids are shown together. 2. Revenue
Trends: That is a chart that breaks down the revenue to customer groups.

Mini-Grid Dashboard
-------------------

Mini-grids are the building blocks of clusters. This dashboard provides
information about the selected Mini-Grid, such as **revenue per
customer**, **targeted revenue per customer type**, **energy sold**,
**actual payment** ,and **the daily weather forecast** is the area where
it can observe and analyze the income distribution of the selected
Mini-Grid.

Also on this page, the status of **tickets** created by customers in the
related Mini-Grid can be observed.

Customers
---------

MPManager customers are listed under ``Customers`` in the sidebar. This
table contains the customers' name, phone number, city, and meter
number. The search function also includes all those fields.

By clicking on a customer, will load the details of that specific
customer.

This ``customer details`` page shows all information about that
customer.

Such as - Basic Details: Name, Surname, Birth Date, etc. - Payment flow:
Is a chart that shows how often the customer makes payments - Addresses:
A list of the addresses that belong to the customer. - Sold Assets: The
assets, that bought by the customer. - A detailed list of the payments.
- Payment types: Shows how the sent money is neem spent (Energy, Access
Rate payment, etc.). - List of tickets that belong to the customer. - A
list of the meters which belong to the customer and a map where the
meters are visually displayed.

Some of the elments are editable (ex:name,surname) or addable
(ex:ticket, address).

Meters
------

The ``Meters`` link on the sidebar loads a list that contains all
registered meters with some additional details such as its serial
number, assigned tariff, etc.. The search area on the page searches in
``serial_number`` and ``tariff name``.

By clicking on a meter in the list, a new ``meter detail`` page will be
loaded. This page, contains ``basic information``, ``meter details``,
and ``meter transactions``. If the meter can send its usage data it also
shows it in an additional ``meter reading`` section. The
``Basic Information`` section contains the total revenue that the meter
made, the owner, when the last payment occurs, and the registration
date. ``Meter Details`` are meter specified details such as the
manufacturer name, the serial number, assigned tariff, and its
connection type. ``Meter transactions`` is a basic list that contains
all transactions that hit the meter.

## Targets By clicking on ``Targets`` in the sidebar will load a page
with already set targets. The list shows only the key fields of each
target. To see the details of a target, click on the ``Expand`` button.

To add a **new Target** just click on the ``New Target`` on the right
top side. After clicking on that button, a new page will be loaded.
Firstly the manager/admin should assign a Cluster or a Mini-Grid (The
difference is already explained
`here <#Information-before-using-MPManager>`__). Then, the date until
that target is valid should be selected.

When these two steps are done; Its time to define our target with some
fields like ``New connections``, ``Revenue per Month``,... None of these
fields are marked as required. That means the manager/admin is free to
enter or not to enter a value for each goal.

Transactions
------------

The page contains two main sections.

1. The comparison section; gives a quick overview of the situation. That
   section contains; Total incoming transactions, Confirmed
   Transactions, Cancelled Transactions, and the Revenue. The part which
   makes that information a bit interesting is the availability of
   comparison. The manager/admin can compare the day with; yesterday,
   same day last week, or the current week with last week or the current
   month with last month.

2. A basic list with incoming transactions. The list has an advanced
   filtering option instead of a basic search as in other pages.

By clicking on a Transaction, the ``Transaction detail`` page will load.
The detail page contains the ``Mobile Provider-specific data``,
``Basic Data``, ``Sent Sms``, and ``Transaction Processing``.

**Mobile Money Provider-specific data:** The name of the provider and
the transaction details. This information is required by the mobile
money provider in case of an issue.

**Transaction Processing:** A detailed list that shows how the incoming
money is been used by the system. Ex: 100$ for Energy, 20$ for Access
Rate, and 400$ for Milling Machine Rate Payment.

Tickets
-------

MPManager is using `Trello <https://trello.com>`__ as a ticketing
platform. All tickets are basically Trello cards. The database is only
holding references to the tickets. The ticketing system aims to resolve
requests and complaints from customers as quickly as possible. It is
important to assign a ticket to the correct category to maintain tickets
easily. Therefore, there are some ticket categories. To add/ list
category please click on ``Categories`` that is listed under ``Tickets``
in the sidebar.

Adding User to Ticketing System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As already mentioned, the ticketing system is using Trello. To be able
to assign tickets internally, all the staff has to be registered on
`Trello <https://trello.com>`__. The user name is been used to associate
the Trello user to MPManager users.

To add a user click on ``Users`` in the list below ``Tickets``. It will
ask you the ``Ticketing System Tag``. That is the name that begins with
an **@** in the Trello user profile.

Maintenance
-----------

In some cases, it is wiser to use external resources to solve small
problems. Maintenance is exactly for that there. The maintenance users
are some experts who are not working for the company but works per
contract.

There is a form to create a **New Maintenance Request**. That page asks
the manager/admin about the job todo, the deadline for the task, the
person who is responsible to do that, and the price for the task. The
created task will be sent out to the external person via SMS. The
created maintenance job/task is also saved as a ticket. The gain by
saving that task as a ticket is, in case of a problem the person who is
assigned to that job can reply to the initial SMS. The incoming SMS will
automatically add to the ticket as a response.

Sms
---

Sms is the key communication infrastructure. It is used by
``Transactions`` and ``Maintenance``. But what if the company wants to
send some inform their customers about something like an unplanned
electricity cut. That is the reason why ``Sms``\ is listed in the
sidebar as an extra service.

The manager/admin can send SMS's to a specific Mini-Grid, to a specific
customer group/type or single customers.

Reports
-------

MPManager has a reports page where managers can download reports. This
page contains weekly, monthly, and payment requests.

System Requirements
-------------------

PHP ^7.3

Node ^v14.3

Installation
------------

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Build the docker containers with ``docker-compose up``

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

All dependencies will be automatically installed on the installation
step. However, if you need additional dependencies, install them in the
``laravel`` container. To Install additional php dependencies enter the
Docker-Container named ``laravel`` navigate to ``mpmanager`` & run
``php ../composer.phar install XXX``

Migrate the database
--------------------

-  Run ``docker exec -it laravel /bin/bash`` to jump into the laravel
   container
-  navigate to ``mpmanager`` directory with ``cd mpmanager``
-  Run ``php artisan migrate --seed`` to initialize the Database. The
   ``--seed`` option will create the default user to login.
-  The default user to login is ``admin@admin.com`` and
   ``basic-password``.

phpMyAdmin
----------

To project also includes phpMyAdmin which enables quick database
operations without installing third-party software or writing any single
line into the terminal.

The default credentials for the database are;

::

    username : laravel
    password: laravel

**Please don't forget to change these before you publish your project**

Building the Frontend
---------------------

The project will automatically build the frontend in the **production**
mode. If you want to build the project in **development** mode, change
``NMP_MODE`` variable in the ``.env`` file.

Essential Configurations
------------------------

There are bound services like the Payment Services (Vodacom Tanzania and
Airtel Tanzania), Ticketing Service(Trello API), Critical Logging
notification(Slack Channel), WebSocket(Pusher), etc. if you plan to get
your payments through these services you need to change/edit following
files/configurations

Mobile Payment Configurations - Vodacom
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ``ips`` array element in ``services.php``. The file is located under
   ``app/config/``. The element ``ips`` holds a list of authorized
   IP-addresses that are allowed to send transaction data.
2. Following changes should be done in the ``.env`` file

   .. code:: bash

       VODACOM_SPID=YOUR-SPID
       VODACOM_SPPASSWORD="YOUR-PASSWORD"
       VODACOM_REQUEST_URL="END-POINT WHERE YOU CONFIRM THE TRANSACTION"
       VODACOM_BROKER_CRT="LOCATION-OF-.CRT-FILE"
       VODACOM_SLL_KEY="LOCATION-OF-.KEY-FILE"
       VODACOM_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY="LOCATION-OF-.CER-FILE"
       VODACOM_SSL_CERT="LOCATION-OF-.PEM-FILE"

Mobile Payment Configurations - Airtel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we set up the second payment provider in our live system, we were
not that experienced by setting up **VPN Tunnels** that's why we go with
the idea 'one tunnel per host\`. Thatswhy the airtel payment integration
is on a separate project for now. We're planning to migrate it into this
project soon.

--> **The project link comes as soon as we uploaded the project to
GitHub** <--

Change the ``api_user``, ``api_password``, and ``ips`` in
``services.php``

.. code:: php

      'airtel' => [
            'request_url' => env('AIRTEL_REQUEST_URL'),
            'api_user' => 'YOUR-USER',
            'api_password' => 'YOUR-PASSWORD',
            'ips' => [
                'ALLOWED_IPS TO SEND YOU TRANSACTION DATA'
            ],
        ],

The following change should be done in the ``.env`` file

.. code:: bash

    AIRTEL_REQUEST_URL="AIRTEL SERVICE URL"

STS Meter Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the system supports only CALIN-STS meters. To be able to
communicate with Calin and generate STS-Tokens, the following changes
should be done; 1. Your key and the endpoint where you create those
tokens.

.. code:: bash

    CALIN_KEY="CALIN-KEY"
    CALIN_CLIENT_URL="CALIN-CLIENT-URL"

2. If you have meters which can send their consumption data to CALIN's
   server please fill the below-listed variables too

   .. code:: bash

       METER_DATA_URL="REMOTE-METER-READING-URL"
       METER_DATA_KEY="METER-READING-KEY"
       METER_DATA_USER="METER-READING-USER"

Pusher(Web Socket)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Pusher is used to notify your admins when a new ticket is been
   created.

   ::

       PUSHER_APP_ID="PUSHER-APP-ID"
       PUSHER_APP_KEY="PUSHER-KEY"
       PUSHER_APP_SECRET="PUSHER-APP-SECRET"
       PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="YOUR-CLUSTER ex. eu"

Slack
~~~~~

Slack is the current critical logging service that alerts the admins
when something went wrong. Like a transaction is been canceled.

.. code:: bash

    LOG_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="SLACK-WEBHOOK-URL"

Installing Customer Registration App (Android)
----------------------------------------------

Please read the project documentation to get an idea of why we're using
a separate app to register customers via an Android-App. Follow the link
to get to the Customer Register App Project

Setup Sms Communication
-----------------------

There are currently two supported SMS-Gateways. 1. Bongo Live Tanzania
2. Inhouse SMS-Gateway Application

Configuration for BongoLive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Important Note: The Bongo API integration on our system is not been
maintained since early-2019.**

Firstly, you have to uncomment these lines in
``app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php``. Because the default
SMSProvider is the 2nd option above.

.. code:: php

     //$this->app->singleton('SmsProvider', function ($app) {
            //   return new \App\Sms\Bongo();
            //});

After that, change the following configuration

.. code:: bash

     'bongo' => [
                'url' => 'http://www.bongolive.co.tz/api/sendSMS.php',
                'sender' => 'SENDER_NUMBER',
                'username' => 'USER NAME',
                'password' => 'PASSWORD',
                'key' =>'KEY',
            ],

Configuration for SMS-Gateway Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Advice: Please read the SMS-Gateway documentation before you
continue.**

To lower the costs of the system we are using the following application
to send and receive SMSes over that application. To be able to use the
application you need to assign following configuration values in
``services.php``

You are not forced to use our inhouse solution for SMS communication.
You can change the SmsProvider easily in
``app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php``

.. code:: php

     $this->app->singleton('SmsProvider', static function ($app) {
                return new AndroidGateway();
            });

.. code:: bash

    'sms' => [

            'android' => [
                'url' => 'https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send',
                'token' => 'FIREBASE_TOKEN',
                'key' => 'PHONE_KEY',
            ],
            'callback' => 'https://mpmanager.local/api/sms/%s/confirm',
        ],

**Dont forget to change the ``callback`` variable to a globaly reachable
domain**

Change Predefined SMS Text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the predefined SMS texts, please edit ``app/Sms/SmsTypes.php``

Weather Data
------------

The system shows the weather data on the Mini-Grid level. To be able to
read out the data from ``Open Weather Map`` service you have to register
yourself there and get an **API-KEY** Change the following value in
``services.php``

.. code:: bash

    'weather' => [
            'owm_app_id' => 'api_key',
        ]

Email
-----

To be able to send E-Mails please edit following configuration variables

.. code:: bash

    return [
        'host' => '', //your host to send through
        'smtp_auth' => true, // enable SMTP authentication
        'username' => '',// SMTP username
        'password' => '', //SMTP username
        'smtp_secure' => PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS,// default is tls
        'port' => '',
        'default_sender' => '',
        'default_message' => 'Please do not reply to this email', // adds a small footer text to your email
    ];

Deploy for Production
---------------------

The production mode will automatically install **Let's Encrypt SSL
certificates**. Therefore you need firstly register a domain.

When you have your domain, the first thing to do is editing ``app.conf``
and ``db.conf``\ (if you planning to use phpMyAdmin as well) files under
``NginxProxy/conf.p``.

Afer that, paste ``chmod +x ./install-production.sh`` to make the file
executable and run it via ``./install-production.sh``. This will guide
you through the installation and finally, it will start the services.

Development
-----------

The development environment is served under **http://mpmanager.local**
To reach the site over the given url; enter the following lines to your
hosts file. #### For Linux/Mac Users

::

    /etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1       mpmanager.local
    127.0.0.1       db.mpmanager.local

For Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
    127.0.0.1       mpmanager.local
    127.0.0.1       db.mpmanager.local

Generate API Documentation
--------------------------

To generate the API documentation, jump in the ``laravel`` container and
type ``php artisan apidoc:generate`` in the **mpmanager** directory.
That will create a new **docs** folder under **public** folder. The API
documentation should be available under
``http://mpmanager.local/docs/``. The whole API documentation will be
migrated to third-party tools like Postman or Swagger.
