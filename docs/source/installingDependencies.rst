Installing Dependencies
=======================

All dependencies will be automatically installed on the installation
step. However, if you need additional dependencies, install them in the
``laravel`` container. To Install additional php dependencies enter the
Docker-Container named ``laravel`` navigate to ``mpmanager`` & run
``php ../composer.phar install XXX``
